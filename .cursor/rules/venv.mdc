When proposing or executing any shell/terminal command for this project's backend directory:

- Always first activate the backend virtual environment:

```bash
cd /Users/erlunlian/agent-checkpoint-replay/backend && source venv/bin/activate
```

- If the environment is already active, proceed without re-activating.
- Prefer non-interactive flags where available (e.g., `--yes`).
- Assume default shell is `/bin/zsh` on macOS.
